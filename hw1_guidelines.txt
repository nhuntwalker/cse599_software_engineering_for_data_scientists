Data basics (Due: 1/12/2016)

Problem:

Obtain the CSV (comma separated variable) file containing the counts of bicycles crossing the Fremont Bridge since 2012 (as described here).
Create a project directory with subdirectories for data and analysis, and create a README file.
Download the data from here. Put the it into the data directory.
Create an iPython Notebook to analyze these data. In the notebook: (1) Isolate the 2015 data, creating fields for date, hour, and count; (2) use python matplotlib to plot the counts by hour; (3) compute the hourly average counts; and (4) determine what is the busiest hour of the day.
Hints

The “date” field is a string coded as “yyyy-mm-dd-Thh” where “yyyy” is the year, “mm” is the month, “dd” is the day, and “hh” is the hour. (You’ll need to write python code to decode the strings.)
The “fremont_bridge_nb” and “fremont_bridge_sb” values are identical since they both contain the sum of north-bound and south-bound crossings of the Fremont Bridge.
